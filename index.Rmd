**Welcome!**

I'm Nihaal Rahman, and I am currently pursuing an MPH in Epidemiology with a Certificate in Applied Biostatistics & Public Health Data Science at Columbia University in New York City. 

I also work concurrently as a Research Affiliate under Dr. Naho Morisaki in the Department of Social Medicine at the [National Center for Child Health and Development](https://www.ncchd.go.jp/en/scholar/research/section/social_medicine.html) in Tokyo, Japan. 

My work has focused on social epidemiology, climate change, global health, and their intersections. You can learn more about professional experience and reseach under my [about](about.html) page. 

I created this website for my [P8105 Data Science I](https://p8105.com/index.html) course. For the professors and the TA's, you can find my [HW4](hw4_dashboard.html) assignment under "Projects" at the top of the page.
